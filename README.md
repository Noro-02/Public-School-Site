# Wapda Public School Website

This repository contains a demo of the **Wapda Public School** website, which I developed as part of a client project assigned by my manager.

##  Project Overview

- **Purpose:** Built for a school to present its information, facilities, and contact details online.
- **Technologies Used:** WordPress CMS and Elementor page builder.

##  Features

- Clean, informative layout suitable for an educational institution.
- Pages for school introduction, faculty, admissions, and contact.
- Designed to be clear and easy for students and parents to navigate.

##  Hosting

The site was deployed by my manager using cPanel. This version is stored locally for my development reference and portfolio.

Some content and images were sourced from the schoolâ€™s Facebook page due to limited information provided directly. A few sections remain incomplete where details were unavailable.
